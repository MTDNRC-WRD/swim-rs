    "# Data Preparation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will extract all the data we need to run both the uncalibrated model and to calibrate and run a parameterized model. The model uses a daily soil water balance, and as such, it needs a daily estimate of meteorological drivers and some *a priori* information on the soils in our sample locations. It also needs an estimate of the state of the vegetation on the surface, for which we use Landsat-based NDVI. With this information, we will be able to run SWIM-RS to estimate the daily ET, soil water storage, recharge, runoff, and simulated irrigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calibrate the model so it behaves more realistically, we must use the parameter inversion software (PEST++, in this case) alongside target data which provides *somewhat* independent estimates of ET and snow on the ground. Once the model is calibrated for a sample plot, these data are no longer needed. Therefore, the calibrated model can be run to times before or after SNODAS or ETf data is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SWIM-RS approach requires a few input datasets to run:\n",
    "1. NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, is a measure made using the red and near-infrared bands of a multispectral instrument. It is a good way to estimate the relative density and vigor of vegetation, which is highly correlated with transpiration, and thus is used as a proxy for the transpirative component of the crop coefficient in SWIM-RS, Kcb. Here, we access NDVI information from Landsat satellite images in Earth Engine.\n",
    "2. ETf: the rate of ET expressed as a fraction of reference/potential ET. This is also known in agricultural water use modeling as the 'crop coefficient', or Kc. For this tutorial we use SSEBop, accessed from Google Earth Engine. We could use results from any number of remote sensing-based modeling approaches (METRIC, OpenET ensemble, etc.). *FOR USE IN CALIBRATION ONLY*\n",
    "3. Soils: We need an initial estimate of soil hydraulic properties that govern the way water behaves in our very simple model soil water reservoir.\n",
    "4. Irrigation: We use an irrigation mask (IrrMapper or LANID) to constrain the data extraction of the irrigated and unirrigated portions of any given sample plot. ## TODO: make this optional\n",
    "5. Snow: We use the SNODAS product to estimate the snow water equivalent (SWE) at a daily time step to calibrate the simple snow model in SWIM-RS. *FOR USE IN CALIBRATION ONLY*\n",

    "# Earth Engine Asset Upload and Remote Sensing Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "1. Upload our data as an Earth Engine asset using the Earth Engine CLI.\n",
    "2. Use the `clustered_sample_etf` function to perform SSEBop ETf extraction.\n",
    "3. Use the `clustered_sample_ndvi` function to perform SSEBop NDVI extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that the Earth Engine Python API is authenticated and configured, and that the Earth Engine CLI is available in your environment."

    "*   **`sparse_sample_etf`**:\n",

    "    *   It runs sample-by-sample, finding Landsat images overlapping each sample and extracting from them.\n",

    "*   **`export_etf_images`**:\n",
